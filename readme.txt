== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What can I use for a shortcode? =
The shortcode `[ tech_support ]` (remove the spaces to use correctly) was recently added for those users that would like to use a post or page for the plugin output.

= How can I get support for this plugin? =
Please note, support may be available on the WordPress Support forums; but, it may be faster to visit http://buynowshop.com/plugins/bns-support/ and leave a comment with the issue you are experiencing.

= Why would I want to install this plugin? =
Often times when you need help with something on your blog it can be quite useful to provide some basic, common information that most every person wanting to help would appreciate. This plugin gives a simple, easy to copy and paste, set of details for support purposes only.

= Can I use this in more than one widget area? =
Yes, this plugin has been made for multi-widget compatibility but it really serves no purpose, yet.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Options Panel.
2. A sample of the sidebar display using the [Desk Mess Mirrored](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/desk-mess-mirrored/) theme.
3. The sample information from the sidebar display copied and pasted into a common text editor.
